ODATA API I've added a postman collection with examples supporting the following series of blog posts: 
You may import the collection from the file saved in this repository. Or you may use this link and the import from link option in postman.

In order to use these examples, you'll need to enter your appropriate settings for your domain, user name, password, etc.
